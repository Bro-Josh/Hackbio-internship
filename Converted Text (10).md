Track 5: AMR in Cancer.SERIAL DILUTION IN AMR IN CANCER: A TOOL FOR CANCER RESEARCH Serial dilution is a critical technique in microbiology, used to reduce the concentration of a substance, typically an antimicrobial agent, in a stepwise manner. In the context of cancer and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), serial dilution plays a significant role in determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents (Blair J.M. et al. 2015)In AMR studies, serial dilution is employed to assess the resistance profiles of pathogens. The method involves creating a series of diluted solutions from a stock solution, usually in a geometric sequence, such as twofold or tenfold dilutions. This technique is widely used to determine the MIC, which is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that can inhibit the growth of a microorganism (Dancer, S. J. 2014) The concept of serial dilution is also relevant in the context of cancer treatment beyond bacterial infections. Cancer cells, similar to bacteria, can develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Serial dilution methods allow researchers to study the effectiveness of cancer drugs by gradually reducing the concentration of the drug and observing the response of cancer cells (Jorgensen, J. H & Ferraro M. J.2009)Cancer patients often suffer from infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), making the treatment even more complex. Serial dilution techniques are crucial in testing the effectiveness of antibiotics against MDROs in these patients. By determining the MIC, clinicians can customize antibiotic regimens to ensure efficacy at the lowest possible dose, reducing side effects and the risk of further resistance (Rosales-Reyes, R & Pérez-Gonzalez, I. 2019). Despite its importance, the serial dilution method has limitations. It is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires precise measurements and handling. Moreover, the static conditions of the test do not fully replicate the dynamic environment within the human body, where drug concentrations fluctuate over time. Therefore, while serial dilution provides valuable insights into drug efficacy and resistance, it often needs to be supplemented with other methods, such as time-kill assays or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, to fully understand the interactions between drugs and pathogens or cancer cells in vivo (Prakash V. et al. 2013).Looking forward, advancements in technology could address some of the challenges associated with serial dilution. Automated dilution systems and microfluidic platforms have the potential to make the process more efficient and accurate (Dandachi I. 2020)References1\\. Blair, J. M., Webber, M. A., Baylay, A.
