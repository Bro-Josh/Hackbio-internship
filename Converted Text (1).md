For thousands of years people were delivered helplessly to various kinds of infections, which

often reached epidemic proportions and have cost the lives of millions of people. This is

precisely the age since mankind has been thinking of infectious diseases and the question of

their causes. However, due to a lack of knowledge, the search for strategies to fight, heal, and

prevent the spread of communicable diseases was unsuccessful for a long time. It was not until

the discovery of the healing effects of (antibiotic producing) molds, the first microscopic

observations of microorganisms in the seventeenth century, the refutation of the abiogenesis

theory, and the dissolution of the question "What is the nature of infectious diseases?" that the

first milestones within the history of antibiotics research were set (Mohr K. I. 2016)

Antibiotics are antimicrobial agents primarily produced by certain bacteria and fungi. These

drugs are some of the biological weapons used by the producers to survive in their dense and

multispecies communities where the resources could be scarce. Thus, the microorganisms, as

antibiotic producers, also have the skills to avoid the antibiotic affect from immemorial time.

Nowadays, resistance to all the antibiotic classes has emerged, which results in 700,000 annual

deaths due to the drug-resistant diseases, and forecasts are dramatic for the coming years

( Barreiro C. &. Barredo J.L. 2021).

When the decision to start treatment is made, it is helpful to be aware of pathogen and

antibiotic susceptibility patterns to assist with antibiotic selection.4 Rarely considered as

increasing the burden of medications for the terminally ill patient, many physicians consider

antimicrobials as a benign intervention even though it may result in adverse events \[ie, adverse

drug effects, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), development and transmission of multidrugresistant organisms (MDROs) in healthcare settings].5-7 In addition to medication burden,

discomfort may result from evaluation procedures (eg, bladder catheterization, blood draws,

imaging studies) and treatment (eg, intravenous lines, mechanical restraints) of suspected

infections (Mamak T. et al.2023)
